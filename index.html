  <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
  <p>    The software development process is an important procedure used to make software applications. 
    The steps in the software development process include: requirements, design, implementation, verification, 
    and maintenance. In the Requirements Stage, a developer must gather information that helps them determine 
    what problem they need the software to solve. Through speaking to the client, questions such as, “What are 
    you solving?” and “Who is using the product?” can be asked to gain a better understanding and move to the 
    next step of the software development process, the Design Stage. In this stage, choices must be made on how 
    the client’s problem will be solved. A plan for building the software will be formed out of these choices, 
    and includes the software’s structure and user interface. The next stage in the software development process 
    is the Implementation Stage, where the software is implemented according to the design established in the 
    previous stage—this is where the actual programming is done. After this, we have the Testing Stage in which 
    the developer must make sure the software meets the requirements and examine bugs or errors through test cases, 
    which is called validating and verifying. The final step in the software development process is the Installation 
    and Maintenance Stage. In this stage, if the software is a boxed product it can be installed on a user’s system 
    by themselves. Otherwise if the software must be installed for the client on their systems then a service must be 
    provided to install it for the client. Maintenance for the software is also required to make sure that the software 
    functions as it is supposed to by fixing bugs and taking in user feedback. </p>
  <p>    Software design is important because we live in the digital age, where technology is a significant part of our daily 
    lives. Due to this, user experience is very important and is directly impacted by software design. It ensures that the software 
    is user-friendly, easily navigated, and accessible. It is also important because programming is no longer enough in the field, 
    you must know how to deal with the whole process to succeed. </p>
  <p>    A software I have used that I think is well designed is Spotify. Music is a very big part of my life, and this streaming 
    platform allows me to discover new music and save my favourite songs very easily due to its simple but effective user interface. </p>

  <h1>Assignment 2</h1>
  <p>1. The requirements gathering stage in the software development process is where a developer gathers information that can 
    help them solve the client’s problem with their software. Developers do this by speaking to their client and asking questions 
    to gain a better understanding, such as, “What are you wanting to solve?”, and “Who do you intend to use this product?”. This 
    stage is important because without knowing requirements and understanding what the product needs to solve, the developer won’t 
    know how to create a software that the client will be happy with. It is essential to the flow of the software development 
    process, the rest of the stages cannot be completed until an understanding is reached. </p>

  <p> 2. </p>
  <p> - As a Spotify user, I want to be able to search for music, so I can stream any song I desire. </p>  
  <p> - As a Spotify user, I want to be able to save music in playlists, so I can organise my favourite music </p>  
  <p> - As a Spotify user, I want to be able to download music, so I can listen to songs offline </p>     
  <p> - As a Spotify user, I want to be able to follow my favourite artists, so I can easily find their music and 
        be notified when they release new music </p>

  <h1>Assignment 3</h1>
  <p>The elements of empathy include: </p>
  <p>1. understanding behaviours: what individuals do and why they do it</p>
  <p>2. recognising motivations: why individuals make certain choices and decisions</p>
  <p>3. considering emotion: empathising with the feelings that individuals have</p>
  <p>4. Understanding culture and context: acknowledging that individuals from different backgrounds have varying needs.</p>

  <p>	 The “Sheep” model assumes customers are passive and easily influenced, with little power in making their decisions. 
    The problem with this model is that it underestimates how complex human decision-making is. The “Homo Economicus” model 
    sees customers as rational—making decisions in their own self-interest and looking for the most value with the least cost. 
    This model’s problem is that it doesn’t take into account emotion and culture with decision making. People are not purely 
    rational and have other motivations. The “Tasks and Goals” model looks at improving how efficient or usable a product/service 
    is based on the customers’ tasks and goals. The problem with this is that it doesn’t factor in the variety of customer experiences. 
    It doesn’t take into account emotions, culture, and context which are necessary to understanding customers and how they think.</p>
  <p>  The “Sheep” model lacks the ‘understanding behaviours’ element by assuming that customers are easily influenced and do not 
  make decisions on their own. This element requires understanding the complex behaviours/individuality of customers. The “Homo 
  Economicus” model lacks the ‘considering emotion’ element by assuming customers only make rational decisions for self-interest. 
  This element requires understanding and empathising with the feelings individuals have that can lead to their decisions. The 
  “Tasks and Goals” model lacks the ‘understanding culture and context’ element by focusing on improving the usability and efficiency 
  of products and services while overlooking the cultural aspects of customer experiences. This element requires acknowledgement that 
  individuals from different backgrounds may have unique perspectives and needs.</p>
