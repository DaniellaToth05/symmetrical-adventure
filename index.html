  <h1>What is the Software Development Process?</h1>
  <p>The software development process is an important procedure used to make software applications. The steps in the 
    software development process include: requirements, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance. In 
    the Requirements Stage, a developer must gather information that helps them determine what problem they need the 
    software to solve. Through speaking to the client, questions such as, “What are you solving?” and “Who is using 
    the product?” can be asked to gain a better understanding and move to the next step of the software development 
    process, the Design Stage. In this stage, choices must be made on how the client’s problem will be solved. A plan 
    for building the software will be formed out of these choices, and includes the software’s structure and user 
    interface. The next stage in the software development process is the Implementation Stage, where the software is 
    implemented according to the design established in the previous stage—this is where the actual programming is done. 
    After this, we have the Testing Stage in which the developer must make sure the software meets the requirements and 
    examine bugs or errors through test cases, which is called validating and verifying. The final step in the software 
    development process is the Installation and Maintenance Stage. In this stage, if the software is a boxed product it 
    can be installed on a user’s system by themselves. Otherwise if the software must be installed for the client on their 
    systems then a service must be provided to install it for the client. Maintenance for the software is also required to 
    make sure that the software functions as it is supposed to by fixing bugs and taking in user feedback.</p>
  <h1>Why is Software Design Important?</h1>
  <p>Software design is important because we live in the digital age, where technology is a significant part of our 
    daily lives. Due to this, user experience is very important and is directly impacted by software design. It ensures that 
    the software is user-friendly, easily navigated, and accessible. It is also important because programming is no longer 
    enough in the field, you must know how to deal with the whole process to succeed.</p>
  <h1> What is an Example of a Well Designed Software? </h1>
  <p>A software I have used that I think is well designed is Spotify. Music is a very big part of my life, and this streaming 
    platform allows me to discover new music and save my favourite songs very easily due to its simple but effective user 
    interface.</p>
